Question: How many patients are there in the database?

Relevant Tables and Columns:
  ADMISSIONS: HADM_ID, DISCHTIME, DISCHARGE_LOCATION, ETHNICITY
  D_ICD_DIAGNOSES: SHORT_TITLE

Reduced Schema:
CREATE TABLE ADMISSIONS (

    HADM_ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,

    DISCHTIME TIMESTAMP(0),

    DISCHARGE_LOCATION VARCHAR(50),

    ETHNICITY VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE D_ICD_DIAGNOSES (

    SHORT_TITLE VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

Expert Knowledge:
To answer the question, we need to count the number of rows in the ADMISSIONS table.

Question: List all admissions with their admission and discharge times

Relevant Tables and Columns:
  ADMISSIONS: ADMISSION_LOCATION, DISCHARGE_LOCATION, LANGUAGE, MARITAL_STATUS
  D_ICD_DIAGNOSES: SHORT_TITLE

Reduced Schema:
CREATE TABLE ADMISSIONS (

    ADMISSION_LOCATION VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

    DISCHARGE_LOCATION VARCHAR(50),

    LANGUAGE VARCHAR(10),

    MARITAL_STATUS VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE D_ICD_DIAGNOSES (

    SHORT_TITLE VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

Expert Knowledge:
* Admissions refer to the rows in the ADMISSIONS table;
* Admission time is the value in the ADMISSION_DATE column;
* Discharge time is the value in the DISCHARGE_DATE column;
* We want to list all admissions with their admission and discharge times.

Question: Find emergency admissions with \"MEDICARE\" insurance.

Relevant Tables and Columns:
  ICUSTAYS: FIRST_CAREUNIT, LAST_CAREUNIT
  TRANSFERS: CAREUNIT
  ADMISSIONS: DISCHARGE_LOCATION
  COST: CHARGETIME

Reduced Schema:
CREATE TABLE ICUSTAYS (

    FIRST_CAREUNIT VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,

    LAST_CAREUNIT VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE TRANSFERS (

    CAREUNIT VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE ADMISSIONS (

    DISCHARGE_LOCATION VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE COST (

    CHARGETIME TIMESTAMP(0) NOT NULL
);

Expert Knowledge:
* An emergency admission is indicated by a value of 'EMERGENCY' in the ADMISSION_TYPE column;
* MEDICARE is an insurance provider; insurance provider can be found in the INSURANCE column.

Question: Show admissions with ICU stays longer than 7 days

Relevant Tables and Columns:
  CHARTEVENTS: ICUSTAY_ID
  INPUTEVENTS_CV: ICUSTAY_ID
  OUTPUTEVENTS: ICUSTAY_ID
  ICUSTAYS: ICUSTAY_ID
  TRANSFERS: ICUSTAY_ID

Reduced Schema:
CREATE TABLE CHARTEVENTS (

    ICUSTAY_ID INT NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY(ICUSTAY_ID) REFERENCES ICUSTAYS(ICUSTAY_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE INPUTEVENTS_CV (

    ICUSTAY_ID INT NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY(ICUSTAY_ID) REFERENCES ICUSTAYS(ICUSTAY_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE OUTPUTEVENTS (

    ICUSTAY_ID INT NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY(ICUSTAY_ID) REFERENCES ICUSTAYS(ICUSTAY_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE ICUSTAYS (

    ICUSTAY_ID INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE TRANSFERS (

    ICUSTAY_ID INT
);

Expert Knowledge:
* Admissions refer to the events in the INPUTEVENTS table where the EVENT_TYPE = 'ADMISSION';
* ICU stays longer than 7 days refer to the events in the OUTPUTEVENTS table where the DURATION > 7;
